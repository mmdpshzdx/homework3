                "Hour of code" event.</a> But before getting started,
                Let us introduce ourselves. Our team consists of

                Baghirova Khavar, and Asadli Sinan.</b></p>

                    attended our team's presentation on ADA University and the

                    to university life, we moved on to solving Code.org puzzles. Using a brief yet engaging game,
                    we attempted to explain the fundamentals of programming to kids following the presentation.

                    between two or three students and they each started working on their own puzzles. After the "Angry Birds" algorithms,
                    we played "Zombie VS. Plants" before moving on to the "Ice Age" puzzles.</b></p><img id="img2" src="media/event (13).jpg">
                    <p id="fourth"><b>The majority of students showed interest in solving these puzzles and did so with a good level of 
                    comprehension. One of us would offer our assistance to pupils when they were having problems or challenges. We would 
                    like to thank the staff of School No. 276 and the fourth graders for their assistance in making this event a success.</b></p>

                    several significant experiences, such as public speaking, our first practical assignment outside of the class, and the capacity to 
                    teach our understanding of the codes to others.</b></p>

                            After finishing the individual part of the assignment, which was learning HTML and
                            CSS by taking courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>, we started 
                            creating the website. It took 3 days to complete the whole website, as all the team members  
                            knew the basics of HTML and CSS. We faced some difficulties while coding and uploading files,
                             which we solved afterwards. And here you are!</b></p>
